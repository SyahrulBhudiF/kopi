# James Hoffmann French Press Method

James Hoffmann's revolutionary French Press technique eliminates the traditional plunge, focusing on clarity and cleanliness through careful timing and decanting.

## Equipment Needed

- French Press (34oz/1L)
- Digital scale with timer
- Two spoons
- Burr grinder
- Separate serving vessel

## Instructions

1. **Grind**: 30g coffee, medium-coarse grind
2. **Add Water**: Pour 450g water at 95°C, start timer
3. **Steep**: Let steep undisturbed for 4:30
4. **Break Crust**: Use spoon to gently break and remove foam/crust from surface
5. **Wait**: Let settle for another 4 minutes (9:00 total)
6. **Decant**: Slowly pour coffee into serving vessel, leaving sediment behind
7. **Serve**: Enjoy immediately

## Key Innovations

- **No Plunging**: Eliminates agitation and sediment disturbance
- **Crust Breaking**: Removes bitter compounds and foam
- **Extended Steeping**: Allows full extraction without over-extraction
- **Decanting**: Separates clean coffee from sediment

## Notes

- The lack of plunging prevents sediment from mixing back in
- Breaking the crust removes bitter oils and foam
- Decanting gives you the cleanest possible French Press coffee
- This method produces surprisingly clean and bright results
- Works excellently with medium roast coffees
- Much cleaner than traditional French Press methods
