# Scott Rao V60 Technique

Scott Rao's methodical approach emphasizes high water temperature, aggressive agitation, and precise timing to achieve maximum extraction and clarity.

## Equipment Needed

- Hario V60 dripper
- V60 filters
- Gooseneck kettle
- Digital scale with timer
- Spoon for stirring
- Burr grinder

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Heat water to 96°C, rinse filter thoroughly, preheat V60
2. **Grind**: 22g coffee, medium-fine grind
3. **Bloom**: Pour 66g water (3x coffee weight), stir vigorously 5 times, wait 30 seconds
4. **First Pour**: Pour 100g more (166g total) in 30 seconds, stir once
5. **Second Pour**: Pour 100g more (266g total) in 30 seconds, stir once
6. **Final Pour**: Pour 101g more (367g total) in 30 seconds, stir once
7. **Finish**: Should complete dripping by 4:30

## Key Principles

- **High Temperature**: 96°C extracts maximum flavor compounds
- **Aggressive Stirring**: Ensures even saturation and extraction
- **Fast Pours**: Maintains high slurry temperature
- **Consistent Timing**: Each pour phase lasts exactly 30 seconds

## Notes

- Stirring is crucial - don't skip this step
- Works exceptionally well with light roast single origins
- Adjust grind if total time varies significantly from 4:30
- The high temperature may seem extreme but is intentional
- Expect bright, clean, and highly extracted flavors
