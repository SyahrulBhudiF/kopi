# Classic Cold Brew

This method produces a smooth, mellow, and low-acidity coffee concentrate. By steeping coarse grounds in cold water for a long time, you extract the sweet flavors without the bitterness associated with hot brewing.

## Equipment Needed

- A large jar or container (e.g., a Mason jar)
- A filter (cheesecloth, fine-mesh sieve, or a dedicated cold brew filter)
- A second container to store the concentrate
- Digital scale

## The Cold Brew Theory

- **Low & Slow Extraction**: Cold water extracts coffee compounds much more slowly than hot water. This process leaves behind many of the acidic and bitter compounds, resulting in a sweeter and smoother profile.
- **Concentrate**: This recipe makes a concentrate, designed to be diluted with water, milk, or tonic to taste.

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Weigh 100g coffee and grind to a coarse consistency (like breadcrumbs).
2. **Combine**: Add grounds to your jar and pour 800g cold or room-temperature water.
3. **Stir**: Gently stir to ensure all grounds are saturated.
4. **Steep**: Seal and let steep for 12–18 hours at room temperature. Longer steep = stronger.
5. **Filter**: Slowly filter into your storage container. Go gently to avoid cloudiness.
6. **Store**: Keep sealed in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

## How to Serve

- **Iced Coffee**: Mix 1 part concentrate with 1–2 parts cold water or milk. Serve over ice.
- **Hot Coffee**: Mix 1 part concentrate with 2 parts hot water.

## Notes

- Best with dark or medium-dark roast for chocolatey flavors.
- Avoid over-stirring to prevent bitterness.
- If weak, next time steep longer or grind finer.
