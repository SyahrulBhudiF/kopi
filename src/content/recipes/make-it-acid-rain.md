# Japanese Acid Rain

A Japanese iced V60 recipe designed to **maximize acidity, capture fruity aroma, and serve chilled over ice**.

## Equipment Needed

- V60 dripper
- V60 filters
- Gooseneck kettle
- Digital scale with timer
- Burr grinder
- Server (carafe)
- Ice cubes & serving glass

## Brewing Logic

- **Lower water temperature (88°C)** enhances acidity and fruity character
- **Adding 1 ice cube in the server** helps trap delicate aroma and cool down the brew gradually
- **Shorter ratio (1:10)** makes the cup more intense and expressive
- **Final pour over ice** locks freshness and bright flavors

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Heat water to 88°C, rinse the filter, and preheat the V60.
2. **Ice Setup**: Place **1 ice cube in the server** before brewing.
3. **Grind**: 15g coffee, medium-fine grind.
4. **First Pour (30g)**: Bloom with 30g water. Wait until 0:45.
5. **Second Pour (60g)**: Pour up to 90g total. Wait until 1:30.
6. **Third Pour (30g)**: Pour up to 120g total. Wait until 2:00.
7. **Fourth Pour (20g)**: Pour the final 20g, reaching 150g total.
8. **Finish**: Drawdown should complete around 3:30.
9. **Serve**: Pour the brewed coffee from the server **into a glass filled with ice**.

## Adjustments

- **For More Fruity Brightness**: Extend bloom time to 45–50s.
- **For More Balanced Body**: Increase water temp to 90–92°C.
- **For Stronger Body**: Grind slightly coarser and extend drawdown.
- **For Lighter Cup**: Dilute with 20–30g hot water before serving over ice.

## Notes

- Best with **medium-light roast** to highlight acidity.
- Use coffee beans with notes **berry** or **fruity**
- Keep pours **gentle and center-focused** to avoid channeling.
- If extraction is too fast (<3:00), grind finer. If too slow (>4:00), grind coarser.
- The **ice cube in the server** captures aroma, while the **ice in the glass** ensures refreshing chill without diluting too quickly.
