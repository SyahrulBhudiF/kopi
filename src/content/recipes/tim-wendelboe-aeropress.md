# Tim Wendelboe AeroPress Method

Tim Wendelboe's AeroPress technique focuses on simplicity and consistency, using a standard position with fine grind and lower temperature for optimal extraction.

## Equipment Needed

- AeroPress
- AeroPress filters
- Stirring paddle
- Digital scale with timer
- Burr grinder

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Place AeroPress in standard position on cup, insert filter
2. **Grind**: 14g coffee, fine grind (finer than pour over)
3. **Add Coffee**: Pour grounds into AeroPress chamber
4. **Add Water**: Pour 200g water at 85°C all at once
5. **Stir**: Stir vigorously 10 times with paddle
6. **Steep**: Wait until 1:20 total time
7. **Press**: Press slowly and steadily for 10 seconds

## Key Principles

- **Fine Grind**: Maximizes extraction in short contact time
- **Lower Temperature**: Prevents over-extraction with fine grind
- **Standard Position**: More consistent than inverted method
- **Quick Process**: Total brew time under 1:30

## Notes

- The fine grind compensates for the short brew time
- Lower temperature (85°C) is crucial with fine grind
- Consistent stirring ensures even extraction
- This method produces a clean, bright cup
- Perfect for light roast single origins
- Very repeatable and beginner-friendly
